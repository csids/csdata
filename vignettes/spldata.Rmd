`csdata` provides structural data for Norway.

Please see https://folkehelseinstituttet.github.io/csdata/reference/index.html for a quick overview of all available datasets and functions.

You can find out what version of `csdata` you have installed by running the following commands:

```{r setup}
library(csdata)
library(data.table)
```


## granularity_geo

The underlying foundation of the `csdata` package is the strict categorization of `location_code` into `granularity_geo`. The concept is that a person should (generally) have data for all values of `location_code` for each `granularity_geo` that they are interested in.
